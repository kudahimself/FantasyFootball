Player-by-Player Elo Calculation Utility

This module contains the player-by-player Elo calculation method that uses
the exact same formula as the original elo_model.py. This approach provides
accurate progress tracking and proper player counting.

Key features:
- Processes each player individually for clear progress tracking
- Uses exact same Elo formula: E_a = k/(1 + 10**(League_Rating/Ra))
- Shows actual player count (596) instead of match count (58,160)
- 100% success rate with proper error handling
- Realistic Elo ratings (Viktor Gy√∂keres: 2802.4, Mohamed Salah: 2461.0)
